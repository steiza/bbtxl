      <div class="column">
        <p>Bike up the Lake Champlain Islands. A very flat day, mostly on the

    <div class="flex">
      <div class="column">
        <p>Mostly on the Lamoille Valley Rail Trail (50 miles, looks like it

        <p>Gravel roads and some two-track through the forest today, and a few

    <h3>Week 1, Day 5: BURLOOP</h3>
    <div class="flex">
      <div class="column">
        <p>Short day. Start out with One Big Climb through the Lincoln Gap,
        grades approaching 20%! Van rides available.  Sadly no view from the
        top without a moderate hike.  </p>

    <h3>Week 1, Day 5: BURLOOP</h3>
    <div class="flex">
      <div class="column">
        <p>Another short day, relatively flat, gravel roads with a bit of 2
        track, getting more populated as we approach Burlington.  </p>

    <h3>Week 2, Day 1: TBVTTG</h3>
    <div class="flex">
      <div class="column">
        <p>The first 15 miles are on Bike Route 7 out of Burlington, the last 3
        miles of which are on a pretty busy road with a wide shoulder. Turning
        off, we cross the Lamoille River and find 6 miles of gravel road
        through some rolling hills, heading back towards the shores of Lake
        Champlain. After a 400ft climb into an through St Albans (and stopping
        for lunch) we pick up the unpaved Missisquoi Valley Rail Trail and ride
        for 13 miles. A short 3 mile jog off the trail (up 200, down 150, up
        200) we camp for the night at Lake Carmi State Park.  </p>

    <h3>Week 2, Day 2: TBVTTG</h3>
    <div class="flex">
      <div class="column">
        <p>Heading back down the hill to the rail trail we ride the remaining
        13 miles of the Missisquoi Valley Rail Trail to Richford. North of the
        Canadian border we pick up La Route Verte 4 for 7 miles up to lunch in
        Sutton. Three miles north of Sutton we leave RV4 and take some (mostly
        unpaved, but there are alternates if you want) backroads to Knowlton.
        Here we pick up the du Lac-Brome Path, following it to Rue Vert 1 and
        tonight’s camp.</p>

    <h3>Week 2, Day 3: TBVTTG</h3>
    <div class="flex">
      <div class="column">
        <p>We follow La Route Verte 1 / Sentier Transcanadien (STC, Trans
        Canada Trail) the entire day as we meander east, passing through
        Mont-Orford National Park along the way. There are a few climbs,
        including a long, straight, boring road (350ft) and into the Park
        (500ft, 4.5 miles, 1.5%.) Then we follow the Massawippi River on the
        STC Les Grandes-Fourches into Sherbrooke. The day ends at a campsite on
        an island in the Saint-François River near its confluence with the
        Magog, just outside the town of Sherbrooke.</p>

    <h3>Week 2, Day 4: TBVTTG</h3>
    <div class="flex">
      <div class="column">
        <p>We continue north on the RV1 / STC Les Grandes-Fourches route,
        meeting up with La Cantonnière route, following the Saint-Francois
        River on a mixture of roads and dedicated unpaved trails. We leave
        marked routes around mile 30, doing 7 miles on a shoulderless, fast but
        low volume road before hitting gravel roads again. Coming into
        Drummonville we cross the river on a ferry and do the last 7 miles on
        quiet residential streets and dedicated bikeways.  </p>

    <h3>Week 2, Day 5: TBVTTG</h3>
    <div class="flex">
      <div class="column">
        <p>After heading south out of Drummonville we turn to the southwest
        along the La campagnarde segment of RV4 for a day of mostly paved and
        unpaved rail trail with a few roads segments. Along the way we pass
        through some small towns including the historic village of Roxton
        Falls. Camping is at Yamasaka National Park, which has a swimming
        beach.  </p>

    <h3>Week 2, Day 6: TBVTTG</h3>
    <div class="flex">
      <div class="column">
        <p>A long day! A few miles out of camp and we’re back onto the STC, La
        Montérégiade, a paved and very straight rail trail into
        Saint-Jean-Sur-Richelieu. Here we stay on the STC, turning north onto
        Lieu historique national du Canal de Chambly until we reach the town.
        From here on we begin to enter the suburbs of Montreal, mostly on
        dedicated bike infrastructure. Hopefully the headwinds aren’t too bad!
        Reaching the St Lawrence River we bike across a lock on the Seaway, a
        bit of Formula1 track, and then through the old port of Montreal.  </p>
